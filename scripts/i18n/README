These scripts were used to convert uDig from Policy-based internationalization 
to Eclipse NLS-based internationalization. For more information, see

The following files are used:
fix.sh - Perform conversion on all plug-ins
createMessages.pl - Create Messages.java and convert messages*.properties
policy2messages.pl - Convert all java files

*** fix.sh ***

fix.sh is a bash script that is intended to be run from the plugins/ directory.
It does the following:
For each plug-in: 
- execute createMessages.pl on each messages*.properties file
- create a messages.properties file in the proper internal directory
- replace all instances of FIXME in Messages.java with the plug-in name 
  (this doesn't work)
- execute policy2messages.pl on every .java file
- delete all files named Policy.java

*** createMessages.pl ***

- runs through all messages*.properties files, converting all periods (".")
  in the key names to underscores ("_")
- creates a Messages.java class using keys from messages.properties

*** policy2messages.pl ***

- runs through the .java files, replacing instances of Policy.bind($key) with
  Messages.$key. This does not work if the call to Policy.bind is split across
  multiple lines (bad code formatter!), or if extra parameters are used in
  the call. 
- converts all periods (".") in the key names to underscores ("_") in keys
  that are referenced
- removes all NON-NLS tags on lines that have been changed
- removes all calls to Policy.localize or Policy.cleanup
- removes all Policy imports
