     * Q:
     * 
     * I'm working on 'transformation' plugin (for RC5) and I've run in some problems during creating the Layer from temporary resource. I'm having the FeatureCollection (result from transformation) and I would like to make a temporary layer from that. I was searching a lot about this in mail list, but still can't understand how I should do it in right way. 
     * When I do it this way it works:
     *     
     *     <pre>
     *     map.getLayersInternal().add(newLayer);
     *     newLayer.getGeoResource().resolve(FeatureStore.class,null).addFeatures(collection);
     *     </pre>
     * but when the Feature collection is big (and ussualy it is)  and uDig starts rendering right after each feature is added, it is very very slow, so I tryed to add  new features first and then to add the layer into the map, but then I get java.lang.NullPointerException
     *     <pre>
     *     newLayer.getGeoResource().resolve(FeatureStore.class,null).addFeatures(collection);
     *          map.getLayersInternal().add(newLayer);
     * </pre>
     *
