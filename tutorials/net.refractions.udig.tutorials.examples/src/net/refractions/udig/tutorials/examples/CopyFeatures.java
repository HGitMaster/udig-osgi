/**
 * This example shows how to copy features from one layer to another.  It assumes there are two layers
 * the first layer is the layer that is the source and the second is the destination.
 * 
 *  <p>
 *  The command used does a great deal of conversion if required.  For example it will automatically convert
 *  polygons to lines if the target layer is a line layer.  It will attempt to map attributes by matching the 
 *  attribute names (it ignores case).
