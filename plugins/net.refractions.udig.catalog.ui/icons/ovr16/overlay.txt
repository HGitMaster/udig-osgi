PALETTE: Eclipse 183 colour palette

Wizard Banner
-------------
     The banner graphic contains an image representing the wizard task, and
should be created with a white to blue, gray scale palette for consistency with
other banners in Eclipse.

     These colors also avoid distracting the user from the important fields
of the wizard.

Wizard Banner Size & Placement
----------------------------------
- size of each wizard banner graphic will vary depending on the elements involved
- but should not exceed 55 pixels wide x 45 pixels high.

    Within the wizard banner space allocation, there is no firm rule for where
to place the wizard banner graphic. Generally, the graphic is centered
vertically, and off-center to the left horizontally.
