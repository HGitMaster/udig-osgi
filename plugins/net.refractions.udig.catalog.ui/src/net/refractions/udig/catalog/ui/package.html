Provides for single shared catalog of spatial data.
<p>
The Local Registry View is a user interface that provides access to the
Local Registry. The Local Registry View allows the user to define and modify the
Data Sources known locally as well as provide functionality for adding the
Data Sources to Maps.

<p>
The example shown above lists a server with defined (layers, road and
stream) and a filesystem (local or remote) is also listed as part of the Local
Registry View. The Layers can be added to a Map. New servers may be
added to the Local Registry.
</p>
<p>
The Local Registry (not the user interface component) is
persistent and can be exported and transferred to other systems.
