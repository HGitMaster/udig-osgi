     * might try to connect to the database in this method rather than isPageComplete() because it
     * is such an expensive method to call.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Remember that this method is <em>only</em> called when moving forward.
     * <p>

     * 
     * <pre>
     * getContainer().run(false, cancelable, runnable);

     * Remember to pass in false as the fork parameter so that it blocks until the method has completed executing.
