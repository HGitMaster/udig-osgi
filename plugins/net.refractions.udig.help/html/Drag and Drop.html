       <p>On some platforms, for example on the Macintosh and Microsoft Windows, the operating system's file system browser can be used to copy folders and files from the file system into uDig.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The resource(s) must be dragged to the exact location in the Projects view hierarchy; they cannot be simply dragged and dropped onto a blank area.</p>

<p>By dragging and dropping information onto a Map new layers will be created:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Open the operating system's file system explorer.</li>
	<li>Locate a supported filetype such as a shapefile and drag it to onto an existing Map in your Project view.<br/>
When dragging data into the Projects view, the project/map that is being dropped into will be selected.<br/>
Drag the file over a project and release the mouse button.</li>
	<li>Notice that the file is opened in a newly created Map.</li>
	<li>This can also be achieved by copying the file in the system explorer, then selecting the destination in the Projects view and choosing <b>Edit &gt; Paste</b></li>
</ol>


<p>By dragging and dropping information onto a Project a new Map will be created:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Drag and drop a link to a support web service (such as a web map server) onto a project folder</li>
	<li>Select several layers from the provided service</li>
	<li>A new map will be created</li>
</ol>


<p>You may also DnD layers directly onto the Layer view, or onto an existing Map.</p>
