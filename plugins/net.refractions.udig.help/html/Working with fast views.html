<p>The Projects view has now been converted into a fast view. This section will demonstrate what can now be done with it.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Confirm that the shortcut bar at the bottom left of the window still has the Projects view and looks like this:<br/>
<img src="Working with fast views_attachments/shortcutbar.jpg" align="absmiddle" border="0" /></li>
	<li>In the shortcut bar click on the Projects fast view button.</li>
	<li>Observe that the Projects view slides out from the left side of the window.<br/>
<img src="Working with fast views_attachments/fastviewenabled.jpg" align="absmiddle" border="0" /></li>
	<li>The Projects fast view can be used as it would be normally. To resize a fast view, move the mouse to the right edge of the fast view where the cursor will change to a double-headed arrow. Then hold the left mouse button down as the mouse is moved.</li>
	<li>To hide the fast view simply click on another view or editor or click on the Minimize button on the fast view's toolbar.<br/>
<b>Note</b>: If a map or page is opened from the Projects fast view, the fast view will automatically hide itself to allow the file to be worked with.</li>
</ol>



<p>To convert a fast view back to a regular view either:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Choose Fast View from the context menu of the icon in the top left corner of the view.</li>
	<li>Drag the fast view icon from the tool bar, and drop it somewhere in the Workbench window.</li>
</ol>
