<p>Selection using a Filter</p>

<p>   1. Open the Select View<br/>
   2. Select a Layer<br/>
   3. The current Filter is displayed at the top, while the results are displayed in a table</p>

<p>Filter Notation</p>

<p>jrmacgill: note there is a difference in meaning between () and []<br/>
jrmacgill: not that there should beâ€¦ but.  I'll explain<br/>
jrmacgill: the [] are used to box off filters<br/>
jrmacgill: the () are used for expressions<br/>
jrmacgill: they are added as it guarantees that the boolean operations will work properly<br/>
jrmacgill: it uses too many of them, but I could not be bothered to be smart (yet).<br/>
           If you take them out then multiple boolen logic operations will work incorrectly<br/>
jrmacgill: A AND B OR C<br/>
jrmacgill: I just boxed everything so that it is explicit<br/>
jrmacgill: [[A AND B] OR C]<br/>
jrmacgill: a good number of those square brackets can go, and you don't need them when you<br/>
           write your own, but the toString plays it safe<br/>
jrmacgill: the interesting thing about bbox is that it can take a null for the left hand side<br/>
jrmacgill: but the parser can't handle that<br/>
jrmacgill: filter = (Filter)ExpressionBuilder.parse("testInteger &lt; 2000"); also works<br/>
Jody Garnett: I am getting a null pointer at some point<br/>
jrmacgill: thats a miss named variable normalyt<br/>
Jody Garnett: I was also trying string EQ = == and so on<br/>
jrmacgill: == should work too</p>
