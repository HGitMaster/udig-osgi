<p>The EditBlackboard is a construct that represents the features that are selected for editing.  Using the selection tools features can be added to the blackboard.  </p>
<ul>
	<li>Clicking on a <em>non-selected</em> feature will clear the blackboard and add the feature to the edit blackboard.</li>
	<li>SHIFT+click will add feaures to the EditBlackboard.</li>
	<li>CTRL+click will add a <em>non-selected</em> feature to the EditBlackboard and will remove a <em>selected</em> feature from the EditBlackboard.</li>
</ul>


<p>There are a few benefits to adding features to the EditBlackboard.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Switching between features on the EditBlackboard is much faster than switching between non-selected features.  Partly because the system doesn't have to communicate with the service and partly because changes made aren't applied to the features.</li>
	<li>Vertices that are shared between features can be moved as one as if there is a coverage model.  There isn't but the editing can almost behave as if there is.</li>
	<li>There is a snapping mode that only searches the EditBlackboard.  This allows the user to choose what features can be snapped to as well as making snapping much faster (the <em>real</em> data doesn't have to be searched).</li>
</ol>
