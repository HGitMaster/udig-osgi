/**
 * Process an Extention Point into items for a List.
 * <p>
 * This interface works with a different set of assumptions then Jesse's origional. It is influenced
 * by the guidelines in "Contributing to Eclipse", and is focused on Object (possibly proxy)
 * creation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Assumptions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Most of the time client code just wants to create an Object, or Proxy
 * <li>Good Fences Rule / Safe Platform Rule - processor makes sure to trap any exceptions, so a
 * single extention point cannot hinder others
 * <li>Conformance Rule - contributions must conform to expected interfaces, we can use Java 5
 * generics to force this point
 * <li>Is an abstract class allowing safe api extention in the future.
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example Use:
 * 
 * <pre><code>
 *  List&lt;Thingy&gt; stuff = ExtentionPointUtil.list( new ExtentionPointProcessor2(){
 *     public Object process( IExtention extention, IConfigurationElement element ){
 *         return new Thingy( element );
 *     }
 *  }
 * </code></pre>
 * 
 * </p>
