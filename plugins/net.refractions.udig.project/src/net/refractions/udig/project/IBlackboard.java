 * StyleBlackboard for the direction we wish to take this class. API should this interface be
 * included?
 * </p>
 * Q: Should this class be cloneable? API explain the use of 'keys' and any uniqueness constraints
 * (Set or List?) API X getX(key) ... should this be X get(key) and let the compiler firgure out
 * which one to call based on the signature? API moreover, you might want to consider on 'Objects'
 * and the use of <T> in the API, using generics to avoid multiple get and put methods. API looks
 * alot like a Map ... either document a comparison or add an extends clause?
