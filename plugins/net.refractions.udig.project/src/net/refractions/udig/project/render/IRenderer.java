/**
 * Responsible for rendering a layer using AWT Graphics2D - this class is
 * assigned a context with a specific GeoResource to use as a source of data.
 * <p>
 * A renderer has the following responsibilities to the rendering system:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A renderer must draw to the image provided by it RenderContext</li>
 * <li>A renderer reprojects victim data if required</li>
 * <li>A renderer applies styles if necessary</li>
 * </ul>
 * The RenderContext contains many utility methods to help smooth the
 * implementation of this required functionality.
 * <p>
 * The IRenderer implementation also knows the most about the data being
 * displayed - as such it has the following responsibilities:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A renderer is responsible for registering with its layers to obtain notifications when the
 * layers' styles change<br>
 * (This responsibility may be revised in the face of IRenderMetrics ability to evaulate the style blackboard)</li>
 * <li>The renderer must notify its adapters(ie listeners) when its rendering
 * state changes - failure to do this will result in the screen not
 * refreshing correctly!
 * <br>(The easiest way to meet this responsibility is to extend RendererImpl)</li>
 * <li>A renderer must call setState() method when its render state changes or it wishes to notify its listeners
 * that it needs to be redrawn.
 * <br>(The easiest way to do this is to extend RenderImpl)
 * <p>
 * The state that the renderer can use are the following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>RENDERING - should be called when the renderer has data that it wishes to display on the
 * screen. May be ignored if the executor uses a timer for refreshing rather than waiting for
 * updates from the renderers</li>
 * <li>DONE - Should be set when rendering is finished.</li>
 * <li>RENDER_REQUEST - should be called when the renderer has received events indicating that it
 * needs to be rerendered. The event listeners should <b>NEVER </b> call render(), instead
 * setState(RENDER_REQUEST) should be used and the frame work will trigger a rerender, most-likely
 * in a separate thread.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>If possible a renderer is responsible for registering with its data source, not layer, so it
 * can receive notices of when the data changes. If another method of recieving update is required
 * then the renderer is held responsible.</li>
 * </ul>

     * <h2>Render State</h2>
     * 
     * Normally the RenderManager will update the screen every second.  However if the renderer has data that must be displayed then
     * it can call setState(RENDERING) and the Screen will be updated immediately.  This should be called with care however since many
     * such calls can cause performance problems.
     * 
     * <h2>Internal Image</h2>
     * 
     * The RenderContext maintains an "internal image" that you can access using getContext().getGraphics();
     * you can use Image.createGraphics() to retrive a Graphics2d to draw with.
     *
     * Example Implementation:<pre><code>
     * public void render( IProgressMonitor monitor ) throws RenderException {
     *     if( monitor == null ) monitor = NullProgressMonitor();
     *     Graphics2D g = getContext().getImage().createGraphics();
     *     render(g, monitor);
     * }   
     * </code></pre>
     * 
     * <h2>Updating a Portion of the Screen</h2>
     * 
     * When the envelope (ie getRenderBounds()) is smaller than the ViewportBounds, the rendered area
     * <b>DOES NOT TAKE UP THE WHOLE MapDisplay</b>. It only takes up the area that the envelope
     * would map to. The purpose of this functionality is to allows only a small area of the
     * MapDisplay to be refreshed rather than the whole area.
     * <p>
     * Please choose the smallest of:
     * <ul>
     * <li>getRenderBounds() - an Envelope in your CRS
     * <li>viewPortBounds()
     * </ul>
