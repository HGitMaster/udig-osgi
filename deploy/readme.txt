uDIG Application
----------------

This directory contains a series of scripts used to package the uDig
application after it has been exported from eclipse.

To use:
1. Download the latest custom JREs into a jre/ folder
2. Export udig.product to a subdirectory 1.2.x/ folder
3. Update versions.sh to reflect the above two settings and the version you are releasing
4. ./clean.sh - to remove the build directory
5. Individual scripts to package:
   ./win32 - package jre, udig.bat
   ./win64 - (pending the availability of an appropriate JRE)
   ./lin32 - package jre, udig.sh
   ./lin64 - package jre, udig.sh
   ./mac32 - renames udig_internal back to udig
   ./mac64 - renames udig_internal back to udig
   ./sdk - very simple script removes configuration and application
5. Upload to:
   http://udig.refractions.net/files/downloads            for stable numbered releases
   http://udig.refractions.net/files/downloads/branches   for SNAPSHOT and M releases
