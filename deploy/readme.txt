uDIG Application: Deploy
----------------
This java project is used to deploy the uDig application.

It contains the "latest" eclipse startup.jar at the time of writing.

The build.xml script that will appear in this directory will make use of
a custom ant plugin that packages up the various Eclipse-Plugins. 

The results are packaged with the plugins from the rich client platform
to produce a working application.
