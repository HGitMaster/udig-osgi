ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK End-User License Agreement

IMPORTANT—READ CAREFULLY: This ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between You (either an individual or a single entity) and Erdas, Inc. (“ERDAS”), having a principal place of business at 5051 Peachtree Corners Cir., Suite 100, Norcross, Georgia, for the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK software product. By installing, copying, downloading, accessing or otherwise using the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK, You agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA. If You do not agree to the terms of this EULA, do not install or use the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK.
1. DEFINITIONS

1.1. COMMERCIAL USE means use that inures to the benefit of or is intended to inure to the benefit of  (a) any governmental unit or agency; (b) any profit-seeking enterprise, or (c) any entity, whether or not for profit, that provides services or products for consideration (for example, an educational institution that performs sponsored research), regardless of whether those services or products directly relate to the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK or were performed or produced using the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK. Notwithstanding the foregoing, COMMERCIAL USE does not include use in a classroom or laboratory setting by a non-profit or governmental educational institution, purely for teaching and academic research purposes and not in connection with any revenue-producing activity. Open-source projects are non-commercial until packaged in a form that the package inures to the benefit of a profit-seeking enterprise or an enterprise that provides services or products for consideration.  

1.2. DECODE means to view files compressed either using Enhanced Compression Wavelet (ECW) technology or otherwise compressed using the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK.

1.3. ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK means the computer software marketed and licensed by ERDAS under that name, consisting of libraries and supporting documents that enable You to write software, or engineer a process, that enables end-users to DECODE files and/or to ENCODE   files.  Among other things, the software enables compression of images according to the JPEG2000 standard, enables reading ECWP streams and enables decompression of files having an *.ecw extension.  The ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK may include associated media, printed materials, and "online" or electronic documentation. The ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK also includes any UPDATES to the original SDK provided to You by ERDAS, but not ENHANCEMENTS.  

1.4. ECWP is the Enhanced Wavelet Compression Protocol, by which compressed files residing on a SERVER may be streamed to an END APPLICATION and DECODED.

1.5. ENCODE means to compress files using ECW technology or to otherwise compress using the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK.

1.6. END APPLICATION means desktop or mobile software products that You develop and that permit an end-user to ENCODE and/or DECODE (among other functionality You develop), and that are intended to be used as self-contained programs for displaying and processing imagery.  The source code of END APPLICATIONS is not intended to be delivered to or modified by a user.  END APPLICATIONS do not run on a SERVER.

1.7. ENHANCEMENTS means non-maintenance improvements, such as new features or versions.

1.8. LIBRARIES means programs that are not END APPLICATIONS and are to be used by programmers, instead of end users who use an END APPLICATION.  LIBRARIES do not, by themselves, ENCODE or DECODE files, but instead are intended to be linked to by END APPLICATIONS that may ENCODE or DECODE files.

1.9. NON-COMMERCIAL USE means use of the END APPLICATION in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, other than COMMERCIAL USE.  .

1.10. SERVER means a computing device in a network that is used to provide services (such as access to files or shared peripherals) to other computing devices in the network. 

1.11. UPDATES means maintenance revisions that correct identified errors in or provide bug fixes for the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK originally provided to You. 
2. LICENSE GRANT

2.1. Non-Commercial Use.

2.1.1. Subject to all other terms of this Agreement, You are hereby granted a royalty-free, nonexclusive, worldwide license to use the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK to create, use and distribute, for NON-COMMERCIAL USES, END APPLICATIONS that DECODE and/or ENCODE. 

2.1.2. Subject to all other terms of this Agreement, You are hereby granted a royalty-free, nonexclusive, worldwide license to use the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK to create, use and supply SERVICES, for NON-COMMERCIAL USES, that DECODE and/or ENCODE.

2.1.3. Subject to all other terms of this Agreement, You are hereby granted a royalty-free, worldwide license to use the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK to create, use and distribute LIBRARIES.  In distributing LIBRARIES, You are licensed only to distribute those compiled portions of the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK in the "redistributables" directory, which contains binaries that another application using the LIBRARY will link to.

2.2. Commercial Use.

2.2.1. Subject to all other terms of this Agreement, You are hereby granted a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK to create, use and distribute END APPLICATIONS that DECODE for COMMERCIAL USES.

2.2.2. If and only if You have validly entered into a Royalty Agreement with ERDAS, and subject to all other terms of this Agreement and the Royalty Agreement, including payment of commercial developer license fees and use and distribution royalties, You are hereby granted a royalty-bearing, nonexclusive, worldwide license to use the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK to create, use and distribute, for COMMERCIAL USES, one or both of the following: (i) END APPLICATIONS that ENCODE and (ii) SERVICES that ENCODE or DECODE.   The royalty rate is listed in the Royalty Agreement that is attached to this License Agreement and that forms a part of this Agreement.  Note that internal use by the developer of an END APPLICATION is a royalty-bearing COMMERCIAL USE if the elements of the definition of COMMERCIAL USE are present.  

ABSENT PAYMENT OF A ROYALTY AND YOUR CONTINUING ADHERENCE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE NOT LICENSED TO USE THE ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK TO ENCODE FILES FOR COMMERCIAL USES OR TO DEVELOP END APPLICATIONS OR SUPPLY SERVICES THAT ENCODE FOR COMMERCIAL USES.

The ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK may be obtained directly from ERDAS or from a person who distributes LIBRARIES containing portions of the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK.  Regardless of the source of distribution and regardless of whether You receive the complete ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK with supporting documentation, as a compiled LIBRARY or otherwise, You must adhere to the terms of this license grant.
3. OBLIGATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS

3.1. Obligation to Support ECWP Read. You agree to do each of the following that applies to Your END APPLICATION and/or SERVICE: (i) supporting the reading of ECWP streams as well as ECW files so that Your END APPLICATION or SERVICE  is capable of receiving streamed, compressed files that adhere to the ECWP; and (ii) your END APPLICATION must provide a means for specifying or selecting an ECWP stream that is consistent with the means for specifying or selecting other data sources in the END APPLICATION.  For the avoidance of doubt, the previous sentence means that if You create or distribute END APPLICATIONS or SERVICES, those END APPLICATIONS or SERVICES must read ECWP streams and must allow a user to access the ECWP stream conveniently, with no more steps than is typical for access to other data formats in Your END APPLICATION or SERVICE.

3.2. Special Obligations for Distributors of SERVICES.  The ENCODE and DECODE SERVICE must be disabled by default in your SERVICES for distribution, but you may permit the user to enable it. The user instructions for enabling must instruct the user that a license is required from ERDAS for the ENCODE and DECODE SERVICE. You may indicate that users of the ERDAS Image Manager or Image Web Server are not required to pay an additional license fee.

3.3. No Source Code Distribution.  Components of the ECW/JP2 SDK used in END APPLICATIONS may be distributed only in object code or executable form; you may not distribute any source code of the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK, or any source code generated by the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK.

3.4. License Requirements for END APPLICATIONS and SERVICES Using ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK. You shall distribute the END APPLICATIONS or SERVICES to end-users pursuant to a conspicuous, legally enforceable end-user license that provides ERDAS with substantially the same protections as set forth in Appendix A hereto.  You agree to take all necessary steps to ensure the enforceability of the end-user license, including, as appropriate: (i) offering a refund of at least a portion of the purchase price of END APPLICATIONS to end-users who disagree with the terms of the end-user license including the terms set forth in Appendix A; or (ii) preventing downloading of END APPLICATIONS or SERVICES without acceptance of the end-user license.  You also agree to take adequate steps to prevent unauthorized use of the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK or its derivatives by end users who decline the end-user license offer, such as by disabling access to Your END APPLICATION or preventing access to features or SERVICES made possible by the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK, including ENCODING or DECODING in Your END APPLICATION or as part of your SERVICES.

3.5. Obligations for Persons Distributing Libraries or Participating in Open Source Projects including the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK.  If You will distribute a LIBRARY or are using the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK in connection with an open-source project or other, similar work, You must distribute this license along with the object or source code of the work and give Your end users the opportunity to decline these license terms and cease downloading the work that contains or uses the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK in whole or in part.

3.6. ERDAS Proprietary Rights Notice. You must include the following statement of ownership/copyright notice in the About Box for Your END APPLICATION, or any other similar location where You place proprietary rights notices pertaining to third party software incorporated in the END APPLICATION:

The ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK may not be shipped, transferred, exported or re-exported into any country or used in any manner prohibited by the United States Export Administration Act or any other export laws, restrictions, or regulations. Each party is responsible for obtaining any and all appropriate permission prior to exporting or re-exporting END APPLICATIONS or LIBRARIES.

3.9. Hold Harmless. You shall hold harmless ERDAS from and against any claims or lawsuits which arise or result from the use or distribution of the END APPLICATIONS or LIBRARIES.
4. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

4.1. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ERDAS AND ITS SUPPLIERS PROVIDE THE ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK "AS IS" AND WITH ALL FAULTS. ERDAS, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS SUPPLIERS, DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, AS TO ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER RELATING TO THE ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY (IF ANY) IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF REASONABLE CARE OR WORKMANLIKE EFFORT, OF RESULTS, OF LACK OF NEGLIGENCE, OR OF A LACK OF VIRUSES, ALL WITH REGARD TO THE ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK. THERE IS NO WARRANTY OF TITLE, CORRESPONDENCE TO DESCRIPTION, AUTHORITY, OR NONINFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK.

5. TERM AND TERMINATION

5.1. Term. The term of this Agreement commences as of Your acceptance of this Agreement and payment of a royalty, if required, and will extend until terminated.

5.2. Termination for Breach. If You materially breach this Agreement and fail to cure that breach within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice of the breach, ERDAS shall have the right to terminate this Agreement any time after the end of such period.

5.3. Survival Provisions. Notwithstanding termination of this Agreement, ERDAS shall enjoy freedom from liability under Section 4; and Your hold harmless obligations under Section  shall also survive.

5.4. Obligations Upon Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement, all licenses shall terminate and You must return to ERDAS or destroy all copies of the ECW/JP2 CODEC SDK or END APPLICATIONS in Your possession, custody, or control, except that You may retain a reasonable number of copies of END APPLICATIONS, not to exceed five (5), for purposes of internal use to facilitate customer support for existing customers only.
