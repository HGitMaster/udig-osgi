       <h1>1 Welcome to the Programmer's Guide</h1>

       <p><b>Welcome to the uDig community&#33;</b></p>

<p>Learning to develop for uDig is hard and it takes awhile to get started. However, once the fundamental design of the uDig system is understood, uDig provides a very powerful foundation for the creation of Geospatial applications.</p>

<p>uDig is two things:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a <b>code base</b> for applications to use, and</li>
	<li>an <b>example application</b> built with that code base.</li>
</ul>


<p>The uDig code is specifically designed as a basis from which to create applications for the manipulation of geospatial data and, indeed, the uDig application testifies that the code serves that purpose.</p>

<p>It is also surprisingly easy to use the uDig code to create different applications. This document is intended to help you learn to use the uDig code base for whatever purpose you choose. Where the two approaches need to be distinguished, <b>SDK Programming</b> will be used to refer to work building new applications and <b>Programming uDig internals</b> will be used to refer to working on the uDig code base itself.</p>

<p>This document aims to help programmers use the uDig code to make better applications for the manipulation of Geospatial data.</p>

<p>As a member of our community you are encouraged to correct any mistakes you find and contribute new content as you learn.</p>

<p>As with any open source documentation this The Programmer's Guide is a work in progress. The people who created uDig have chosen to focus first on the code.</p>

<h2><a name="1WelcometotheProgrammer%27sGuide-UsingtheMailingList"></a>Using the Mailing List</h2>

<p>If you need help on a particular topic, please ask on the uDig mailing list.</p>

<p>The programmers of uDig itself may be able to compose a specific answer to your question and add it to this guide right after you ask. So please ask; hopefully someone knowledgeable will compose a useful answer.</p>
