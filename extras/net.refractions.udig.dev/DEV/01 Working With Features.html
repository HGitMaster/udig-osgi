       <h3><a name="01WorkingWithFeatures-HowtocreateaFeature"></a>How to create a Feature</h3>

<p>This page explains how to create a Feature for one or more of your Plug-ins.  A Feature is a bundle of Plug-ins.  The main reasons for creating a Feature are:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Logically group together a number of plug-ins for distribution together</li>
	<li>Group Plug-ins together for use with an update site</li>
	<li>A Feature has (optional) Branding information associated with it, for example <em>About</em> information and <em>Icons</em> that appear in the Help&gt;About ... Dialog</li>
</ol>


<p>Products can be created from Plug-ins or Features, but if they are created from Features then an update site can be used to keep the product up-to-date.  This cannot be done with out a Feature based product.  </p>

<p>New Features can also be installed by the Eclipse update framework.  If a Feature is added to an update site then any Eclipse based application can install the Feature using the Software Updater (usually under the Help menu).  </p>

<h3><a name="01WorkingWithFeatures-CreatingaFeature"></a>Creating a Feature</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Create a Feature Project. <b>New-&gt;Project</b>.</li>
	<li>Select <b>Feature Project</b> in the <b>Plug-in Development</b> category</li>
	<li>The naming convention is:
	<ol>
		<li><b>Feature ID</b> - An ID usually URI.featureName for example net.refractions.community.jody.visual</li>
		<li><b>Feature Project</b> - the Feature ID with _feature appended to the end.</li>
		<li><b>Feature Name</b> - Unimportant but should usually be translatable (%feature.name in the feature.xml and the key/value pair in the plugin.properties)<br/>

	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Press Finish</li>
	<li>A nice editor for the Feature.xml is opened.  In the Branding Plug-in Field enter the Branding plug-in you created for this feature (or enter the name of the Branding plug-in you are going to create).</li>
	<li>Switch to the <b>Plug-ins</b> tab of the editor (tabs are across the bottom)</li>
	<li>Press <b>Add ...</b></li>
	<li>Select the Plug-ins that will be part of the Feature<br/>

</ol>


<p>There is numerous other options for specifying what Features and Plug-ins the Feature depends on as well as what versions and how to install the Feature.  This is all that is really required to make a Feature.</p>

<h3><a name="01WorkingWithFeatures-ExportingaFeature"></a>Exporting a Feature</h3>

	<li>Switch to the <b>Overview</b> tab</li>

	<li>Follow wizard's instructions</li>
</ol>
