       <h3><a name="HowdoImakeanewtypeoflayer-Q%3AHowdoImakeanewtypeoflayer%3F"></a>Q: How do I make a new type of layer?</h3>

<p>First one must understand what a layer is before they can understand how to make one:</p>

<p>A layer in uDig is (very generally) a set of IGeoResources which are handles for the same "real" resource.  An example is a WFS and a WMS may be backed onto the same data.  As a result both IGeoResources would be members of the layer's set of IGeoResources.</p>

<p>So, to define a new <b>type</b> of layer one must create a new IGeoResource (and IService since IServices contain the IGeoResources).  For example a Web Terrain layer would require a Web Terrain IService and IGeoResource.</p>

<p>For more information on the Catalog API see the <a href="2 Catalog.html" title="2 Catalog">Catalog Overview</a> in the <a href="2 Programmer's Guide.html" title="2 Programmer's Guide">Programmer's Guide</a>.</p>

<p>However once a new layer type is created it does not automatically get rendered unless one of its IGeoResources resolves to a DataStore, GridCoverage or a WebMapServer.  If one of the IGeoResources does resolve to one of those objects then you are done and the layer will render.  If not then a new Renderer must be developed.
