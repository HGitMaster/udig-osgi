       <h1>User Interface Workflow</h1>

       <p>Eclips RCP gives us two user interface workflows (for managing the workbench and managing editors in the workbench). This covers a lot of ground (from navigation and bookmarks to an undo system).</p>

<p>RCP SDK:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li><a href="#UserInterfaceWorkflow-WorkbenchWorkflow">Workbench Workflow</a> - open / exit</li>
	<li><a href="#UserInterfaceWorkflow-MapWorkflow">Map Workflow</a> - open / navigate / close</li>
</ul>


<p>In adition uDig contributes several workflows for content we manage:</p>

<p>uDig SDK:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li><a href="#UserInterfaceWorkflow-ServiceWorkflow">Service Workflow</a> - import / export service</li>
	<li><a href="#UserInterfaceWorkflow-ScratchWorkflow">Scratch Workflow</a> - create / save</li>
	<li><a href="#UserInterfaceWorkflow-EditWorkflow">Edit Workflow</a> - edit tools / commit / revert</li>
	<li><a href="#UserInterfaceWorkflow-TaskWorkflow">Task Workflow</a> - validate / tasks / fix</li>
</ul>


<p>Where possible we have maintained compatibility with the Eclipse User Interface Guidelines.</p>

<h1><a name="UserInterfaceWorkflow-EclipseRCPWorkflows"></a>Eclipse RCP Workflows</h1>

<h2><a name="UserInterfaceWorkflow-WorkbenchWorkflow"></a>Workbench Workflow</h2>

<p>You can create multiple workbench windows, closing the last window will exit the application.</p>

<p>When you exit the application you will be prompted to "save":</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>any modified maps</li>
	<li>any temporary results</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="UserInterfaceWorkflow-MapWorkflow"></a>Map Workflow</h2>

<p>As an actual RCP "Editor" our Maps follow a open / save / close / close all work flow.</p>

<p>We make use of navigation tools to control what is visible in the Map. Navigation forward and back buttons allow the user to sift through previous locations.</p>

<p>Locations can be bookmarked for future reference.</p>

<h3><a name="UserInterfaceWorkflow-Close"></a>Close</h3>

<p>Close will prompt the user for action if there is any:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>unsaved changes to the Map</li>
	<li>transactions with external services</li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="UserInterfaceWorkflow-Layers"></a>Layers</h3>

<p>Maps are defined as a series of layers:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>New Layer - looks wrong?</li>
	<li>Add Layer</li>
	<li>Delete Layer</li>
</ul>


<p>A Layer is defined as a reference to a GeoResource and a Style. Any change to Map structure (including Layer style) is tracked as an edit and can be managed with the Undo / Redo history.</p>

<h3><a name="UserInterfaceWorkflow-Save%28andSaveAll%29"></a>Save (and SaveAll)</h3>

<p>Save is used to store the current state of the Map (ie layer information a and viewport).</p>

<p>Since we are a client application the Map also be involved in:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>transactions with external services</li>
	<li>creation of temporary (ie scratch) content</li>
</ul>


<h1><a name="UserInterfaceWorkflow-uDigSDK"></a>uDig SDK</h1>

<h2><a name="UserInterfaceWorkflow-ServiceWorkflow"></a>Service Workflow</h2>

<p>Services are used to access geospatial content; while managing services is a perfectly reasonable activity it is not the point of a GIS application. </p>

<p>You can <b>Import</b> additional services into the uDig application, and also <b>Remove</b> services that are not in use.</p>

<h3><a name="UserInterfaceWorkflow-Export"></a>Export</h3>

<p>You can use export to take information known to uDig and export it to an existing Service. In the case of file formats you can create a new File to hold the content.</p>

<h2><a name="UserInterfaceWorkflow-ScratchWorkflow"></a>Scratch Workflow</h2>

<p>The concept of a "Scratch pad" is used to handle temporary results; there are two ways in which a temporary result would be created:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>explicitly using Layer &gt; Create</li>
	<li>explicitly using a Editing Tool</li>
</ul>


<p>A scratch layer lasts for the duration of the uDig application; the user is prompted to to save a scratch layer:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>when they close a map that displays the scratch layer</li>
	<li>when they exit the application</li>
</ul>


<p>When saved (similar to export) a scratch layer will be replaced with the newly created georesoruce.</p>

<p>The Scratchpad service is avaialble to any plugin developer wishing to work with temporary results.</p>

<h2><a name="UserInterfaceWorkflow-EditWorkflow"></a>Edit Workflow</h2>

<p>Edit tools and various feature editors allow for interaction with external services. External services are handled within a transaction using a commit / rollback workflow.</p>

<p>Any number of changes may be made (using any view or edit tool), the changes are not sent to the server until commit is called.</p>

<h2><a name="UserInterfaceWorkflow-TaskWorkflow"></a>Task Workflow</h2>

<p>The Task workflow is a traditional user focused workflow; the list of tasks represents work that needs to be done; each task can carry with it enough context information to help the user address the task.</p>

<p>Here is an example of its use with the validation operation:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Validation Operation generates a series of Issues</li>
	<li>User preses "Fix" on an Issue</li>
	<li>The feature in question is brought up on screen</li>
</ol>


<p>In a workgroup environment the Task list should be stored on a shared database; or intergrated with an existing workflow system. The Task workflow is available to any uDig plugin developer.</p>
