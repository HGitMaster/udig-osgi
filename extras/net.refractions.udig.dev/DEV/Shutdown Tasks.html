       <h1>Shutdown Tasks</h1>

       <p>The ShutdownTaskList object provides a consistent way to schedule tasks that need to be run on shutdown.  This is a better solution that running shutdown tasks in a plugin's shutdown method because the tasks are:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Ran in a safe environment so all tasks are guaranteed to run even in the face of exceptions being raised.</li>
	<li>Provides a single ProgressDialog for all tests to update rather than either opening a seperate dialog for each task or running silently in the background.</li>
</ol>


<p>The ShutdownTaskList is a singleton and can be obtained using the ShutdownTaskList.get() method.  Tasks can be ran just before shutdown or after the workbench has been shutdown.  Currently only the Pre-shutdown tasks have a Progress Dialog associated with them because all UI components are disposed of once the workbench has been shutdown.</p>
