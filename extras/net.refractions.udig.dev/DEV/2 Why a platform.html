       <h1>2 Why a platform</h1>

       <p>The Java GIS community is already host to several open-source toolkits of great capability. These toolkits provide a great number of services, and allow you the software developer to communicate with a wide varity of spatial information.</p>

<p>The UDIG framework goes the extra mile, providing a well structured application for you to extend. As a software developer you can focus on your tasks needed for your problem. The finding, connecting and display of spatial information can be someone else's problem.</p>

<h1><a name="2Whyaplatform-RelationshipwithLibrariesandToolkits"></a>Relationship with Libraries and Toolkits</h1>

<p>You will find that uDig is set up as a platform allowing you to work "out of the box" with:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>GeoAPI interfaces; these is a set of Java interfaces produced on commercial standards (provided by the Open Geospatial Consortium) and International standards (provided by the International Standards Origination)</li>
	<li>GeoTools interfaces and implementation</li>
	<li>JTS Toplogy Suite: provides the implementation of Geometry (ie the "Shapes") you see on the screen</li>
	<li>...</li>
	<li>Your own own domain objects</li>
</ul>


<p>This is by no means a closed set; community plug-ins have experimented with:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>R for stats analysis</li>
	<li>C libraries like GDAL and OGR</li>
	<li>C++ libraries like OSSIM</li>
</ul>


<p>If you hear of a good toolkit or library please ask on the email list; we would be happy to help you hook it up.</p>
