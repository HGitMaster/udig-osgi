       <p>Q: My plugins export but don't work in uDig.  What is going on?</p>

<p>A:<br/>
The common suspects are:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The plugin depends on another plugin that is not part of the uDig your plugin is installed in.  If a plugin depends on a missing plugin then that plugin will be deactivated</li>
	<li>Make sure that all the required resources are checked off in th build.properties editor.  The build is the important one for running and exporting</li>
	<li>If you made a plugin that contains code as well as other jars then on the runtime tab of the Manifest.MF editor you must make sure that the all the extra jars <b>and</b> a . are in the Classpath list.  (The period is intensional as it indicates the code of this plugin).
	<ul>
		<li>This last point is important only if the build.properties Runtime Information maps . to your source directory.  If the mapping is to a jar then make sure that jar is in the classpath of the manifest.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The exported plugin and the current udig build were compiled with different jdk. -debug -consoleLog as program arguments help to keep track of such errors.</li>
</ol>
