       <h1>3 Platform Architecture</h1>

       <p>The UDIG GISPlatform is built around the concept of plug-ins to the base Eclipse Rich Client Platform. Several other well-known eclipse plug-ins are used, such as the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and the Graphic Modeling Framework (GEF).</p>

<p><img src="download/attachments/3484/TierDiagram.gif" align="absmiddle" border="0"/></p>

<p>It is useful to consider the UDIG application as a series of Tiers each with different responsibilities and capabilities.</p>

<p>If you are new to Eclipse RCP development it is helpful to go through the tutorials included with Eclipse prior to working with uDig.</p>

<h1><a name="3PlatformArchitecture-GISToolkits"></a>GIS Toolkits</h1>

<p>Tier 0: The Toolkits used, such as GeoTools and GeoAPI, provide useful abstractions (such as Features) and data connectivity. These libraries are all gathered into a single plug-in (net.refractions.udig.libs plugin) so they may share a classloader.</p>

<h1><a name="3PlatformArchitecture-GISPlatform"></a>GIS Platform</h1>

<p>Tier 1: Catalog Services provide a common API for data access and may serve as foundation for different GIS applications </p>

<h1><a name="3PlatformArchitecture-GISApplication"></a>GIS Application</h1>

<p>Tier 2: Project services opperates as a UDIG application providing Maps and Printing under user control </p>

<h3><a name="3PlatformArchitecture-VisualizationandInteraction"></a>Visualization and Interaction</h3>

<p>Tier 3: Rendering and Tool services allow control of display and screen interaction. </p>
