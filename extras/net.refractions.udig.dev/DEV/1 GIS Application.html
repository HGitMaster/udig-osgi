       <h1>1 GIS Application</h1>

       <h1><a name="1GISApplication-GISApplication"></a>GIS Application</h1>

<p>The GIS Application, when executed is the barebones uDig application. It represents a simple and capable GIS application. This is, however, only the begining.</p>

<p>You can extend uDig in two ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li>customize uDig for your needs through the addition of plug-ins</li>
	<li>defining a new application based on uDig</li>
</ul>


<p>Both of these activities are made in reference to the GIS Application tier. While the GIS Platform provided programatic access to spatial information there was nothing visual about it. The GIS Application refines these ideas into the concept of Projects, Maps, Layers on the data modeling side. On the user-interface side the GIS Application tier defines the MapEditors, the Layers view and many more ways of interacting with the central data model.</p>

<p>The GIS Application data model was constructed using the Eclipse Modeling Framework, you do not need to know anything about EMF to use the GIS Application data model. We have provided the <em>usual</em> concepts of listeners and events</p>
