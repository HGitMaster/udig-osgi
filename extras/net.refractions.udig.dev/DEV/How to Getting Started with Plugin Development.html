<p>Sounds like fun!</p>

<p>Well we are happy to help with facilities over here, as in we can set up up with subversion space in the community section. You should sign up to the developers email list and work your way through the initial quickstart and plug-in tutorial.</p>

<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Sign up: <a href="http://lists.refractions.net/mailman/listinfo/udig-devel">http://lists.refractions.net/mailman/listinfo/udig-devel</a></li>
	<li>Install: <a href="http://udig.refractions.net/confluence//display/ADMIN/SDK+Quickstart" title="SDK Quickstart">SDK Quickstart</a> for simple plugins (or UDIG:Project Quickstart for core development)</li>
	<li>Follow: <a href="2 Plugin Tutorial.html" title="2 Plugin Tutorial">2 Plugin Tutorial</a></li>
</ol>


<p>From there on out you can start to get our own uDig/Eclipse RCP docs and pick up some Eclipse books (for help in making a user interface and so on), and I assume you are familiar with the MySQL/JDBC part of things?</p>
<ol>
	<li>Read: <a href="Home.html" title="Home">Home</a></li>
	<li>Read: <a href="5 Reading List.html" title="5 Reading List">5 Reading List</a></li>
</ol>


<p>One thing I should note, our docs are on as an needed basis, so as you have questions we will due our best to make a page of docs to answer email, and help people later. So you you are already on the right track, ask questions!</p>

<p>I have managed to develop a plug-in and is linking with a uDig very well. Is it possible to make a 'view' to apear like a form, with textboxes and buttons.</p>

<p>I need to create  form which will allow users to enter/select values. For example, i put a link on the view and when a user doubleclick it a form is poping up. </p>

<p>currently my form opens outside eclipse!<br/>
