= Introduction =

The files:
* pull_files.groovy
* push_files_back.groovy
are scripts that can be used to gather the files fo uDig 
that contain gui messages and need to be translated.

For safetyness it is not possible to add new files with 
this methodology, but only modify existing ones.
This is due to the fact that if you are a translator and 
not a developer, you probably should ask for one to
add a new file for you. Once a file is added in the repo,
it will be pulled and pushed by the scripts.

Let's get started!

Using the scripts will need you to have groovy installed.
If you need help on this please ask in the uDig mailinglist.

= Getting all the files to translate =

You can copy all the files that contain messages that need 
translation by issuing from within the folder:
udig-platform/extras/plugin-translations (you should be here already)
the command:
    groovy pull_files.groovy

This will copy all the files from the uDig plugins file structure
into the folder "properties", giving the files a name that 
keeps track of their original position in the uDig file tree.

= Translate files =

You can now translate the files that are contained in the 
properties folder. They are of two types:

1) messages.properties or messages_xx.properties
2) plugin.properties or plugin_xx.properties

xx represents the locale fo your language. So if you want 
to modifiy or extend the Italian translation, pick the file
plugin_it.properties or messages_it.properties

If you have the chance to open the files inside the eclipse IDE,
consider to install the ResourceBundle Editor, which can be found here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipse-rbe/

= Push the translated files back to uDig =

You can copy all the files back into the uDig file tree
by issuing the command:
    groovy push_files_back.groovy

This will push all the properties files back into the 
uDig file tree and overwrite the existing ones. 

The versioning system will understand which files were changed
and which ones not and it will be easy to commit to the repository
the changes.
